# Genetic Mosaic: 12S Alignment of Great Lakes Fishes

This project is designed to tell a **visual story of biodiversity** in the Great Lakes through a curated alignment of mitochondrial 12S sequences from regional fish species. The goal is to present a holistic, comparative view of genetic variation across species using a single gene region.

## Overview

- Based on a 12S reference alignment developed in the Molecular Ecology Lab at Michigan State University and previously used in [Sard et al., 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/edn3.38).
- 142 total aligned sequences, including some variant duplicates to capture within-species diversity.
- UGENE was used for final trimming and filtering (e.g. removing Homo sapiens). The alignment was then imported into R for data cleaning and visualization, and finally into Adobe Illustrator for minor clarity and graphical improvements.

The final figure visualizes biodiverstiy along a molecular scale, illustrating both the genetic similarities and differences of Great Lakes fishes at a glance.
